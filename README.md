## Technical Analysis Methods
- Moving averages (10, 20, 50 days)
- Correlation matrices
- Volume analysis
- Volatility calculations
- Return distributions

## Risk Factors
1. Company-Specific:
   - Regulatory changes (GOOG, AMZN)
   - Product cycles (AAPL)
   - Enterprise spending (MSFT)

2. Market-Wide:
   - Tech sector rotation
   - Interest rate sensitivity
   - Macro-economic impacts

## Future Considerations
- AI and cloud computing evolution
- Regulatory landscape changes
- Consumer behavior shifts
- Enterprise technology adoption patterns

## Recommendations
Based on our 2013-2018 analysis, we recommend a strategic portfolio allocation: 40% MSFT (core stability), 25% AAPL (growth/sector indicator), 20% AMZN (diversification), 15% GOOG (tech exposure). Optimal entry points align with earnings seasons for enhanced liquidity. Risk management should include quarterly rebalancing and 2% stop-losses below key moving averages. Consider increasing MSFT positions during market stress and AMZN exposure during retail seasons. Monitor AAPL for sector-wide signals and GOOG for regulatory impacts. This balanced approach leverages each stock's strengths while maintaining risk-adjusted returns.
